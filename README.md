## A Little Bit About Me :sunglasses:

I am a data-driven problem solver with a passion for leveraging data to drive business success. I have spent my time developing my skills in data engineering, building robust pipelines, and transforming raw data into structured, actionable insights. My experience includes designing scalable ETL workflows with tools like Azure Databricks and PySpark, and Iâ€™ve used my expertise in Python and SQL to process, analyze, and optimize large datasets.

As I continue to grow my skills and expertise, I am excited to team up with others and tackle meaningful data engineering projects. Whether itâ€™s crafting efficient data pipelines, optimizing cloud-based architectures, or enabling analytics that drive business growth, Iâ€™m all in for making an impact with data.

**I recommend looking through the pinned repositories which showcase my skills.**

I spend my free time playing Chess.
